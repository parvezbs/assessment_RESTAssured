# assessment_RESTAssured
This is REST API test automation which evaluates the responses provided by the DARKSKY api.

We are using Jackson as the JSON parser and we have also written Po-JO classes to 
serialize and de-serialize the json objects to read and buils JSON payloads.

But after a PoC with robot framework, it is made very clear that we can use robot framework with less hastle and code.
Also, the inbuilt reporting provides just awesome flexisbility to write our own functions to evaluate the objects and perform 
REST api actions very easliy. Please refer to my robot framework assessment for more information.
